# word_cloud_from_frequencies
This project was completed for "Crash Course on Python" by Google. In this project I was supposed to take some text file and clean that data. Along with removing punctuations from the text, I had clean it and prepare it for word-cloud. Then i had to count frequency of words, store them in dictionary, and finally plot a word-cloud.
