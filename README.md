# word_cloud_from_frequencies
This project was completed for "Crash Course on Python" by Google. In this project I was supposed to take some text file and clean that data. I downloaded a text file from interent, that was open-source and available to use for anyone. You can take some text file of your choice as well. Along with removing punctuations from the text, I had to clean it and prepare it for word-cloud. Then i had to count frequency of words, store them in a dictionary, and finally plot a word-cloud by passing that dictionary to wordcloud module.
